# ECE-GY 9953 Awesome Inc Frontend

This is the frontend codes for an online superstore web application, which is part of the ECE-GY 9953 Advanced Project.

## Prerequisites
Created with [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) version 18.2.0 and [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) version 4.23.6. <br/>
[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 16.15.0.

### Package Management
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) are both fine. In my experience, [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) works with [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) better.

### Packages
Run ```yarn install``` or ```npm start``` to install all the packages used for this project.


## Run the program
Locate the terminal to the *src* folder and run ```yarn start``` or ```npm start```. <br />


## Features
### Major Features	
Consists features based on the CRUD operations.

#### Customer
The customer could register, log in, forget and reset password, change the password after logging in, go to the account information page and view the profile of the customer and edit the information.

#### Address
Functionalities associated with the address include: adding an address to the customer profile,  getting the addresses of the customer after logging in, and updating and deleting an address on the customer profile.

#### Product & Order
The customer could search for a product and view the details including the unit price and the discount percentage of the product. Then the customer can add products to the shopping cart and place an order. The customer can also view the order history and choose to return an order within 30 days of the shipping date.

#### Admin
The administrator could log into the system, and view and change the stock of a product.

### Security Features				
		
#### XSS attacks prevention
JSX produces React elements and React produces separate components. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered. => Safe to embed user input and ensures that attackers can never inject anything thatâ€™s not explicitly written in our web application. 

#### JWT
Chose the Bearer Token as the JWT. The bearer token is a cryptic string, generated by the Spring Boot backend. Sent in the HTTP Authorization header when making requests to protected resources.
